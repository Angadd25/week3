        <h4>Which TVs use the Least Energy?</h4>
        <img src="../images/Bar Chart.png" alt="tv energy consumption" id="graph1">
        <p>OLED TV has higher energy consumption than LCD and LED</p>
        <p>However, people should use more LCD or LED for less energy consumption.</p>

        <h4>Does Screen Size Mean More Power?</h4>
        <img src="../images/Scatter Plot.png" alt="screen size" id="graph2">
